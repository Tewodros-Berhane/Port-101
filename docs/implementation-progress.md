# Implementation Progress

## Completed

- Core foundation: auth, RBAC, multi-company, UUIDs, company scoping.
- Master data schema: migrations for partners, contacts, addresses, uoms, currencies, taxes, products, price_lists.
- Master data models: Partner, Contact, Address, Uom, Currency, Tax, Product, PriceList with UUIDs, CompanyScoped, soft deletes, created_by/updated_by.
- Master data CRUD: controllers, requests, Inertia pages, and routes for partners, contacts, addresses, products, taxes, currencies, uoms, price lists.
- Contacts and addresses permissions: `core.contacts.*` and `core.addresses.*` seeded and enforced via policies.
- Permissions: per-entity permissions seeded; owner role gets all permissions; legacy core.master_data.manage removed.
- Authorization wiring: policies for Partner/Contact/Address/Product/Tax/Currency/Uom/PriceList; AuthServiceProvider registers them; controllers call `$this->authorize()` for CRUD actions; base Controller uses AuthorizesRequests.
- Access rules: super admin is view-only for master data; company owners (is_owner) bypass and get full access.
- Tests: feature test covering master data policy behavior for super admin view-only and owner bypass.

## Not Yet Implemented

- Master data UI gating (nav visibility by `.view`, create/edit/delete by `.manage`).
- Audit log module and events.
- Route-level permission tests for master data endpoints (403/200 flows).
